0.8.14 (20-May-2022)

  * Support for PG 14

0.8.13 (18-May-2022)

  * Revert to 0.8.10 as 0.8.12 didn't really work.

0.8.12 (28-Dec-2020)

  * Same as 0.8.11 but reverting a commit that I'm not confident in that may or
    may not impact the sql query escaping

0.8.11 (23-Dec-2020)

  * Update indexes when predicates changes

0.8.10 (07-Oct-2020)

  * use pyyaml's C-based parser, which is an ~order of mag faster

0.8.9 (27-Aug-2020)

  * yaml should not unnecessarily quote column names indexes

    This bandaids over the issue where a reserved keyword as
    column name results in different yaml files, causing us to
    drop and recreate the index

    This fix is only for indexes so I presume we'll hit it with
    views or something else also

0.8.8 (10-Dec-2019)

Remove "Support renaming of tables"

  * It's a feature that we don't need and we're just trying to get Postgres 11
    working

  * We never used 0.8.6 in production so while the changes are probably fine,
    I'm just trying to reduce the amount of change at the moment

0.8.7 (10-Dec-2019)

Postgres 11 Support

  * Cherry-picked the commit from upstream that added Postgres 11 support
    e082b0ad4aad8fdafb504bb20e9c0d95a2d3c92b

0.8.6 (09-July-2019)

Support renaming of tables

  * Setting oldname on a table will result in renaming of the table with
    correct column changes if needed

  * A view with the same name as an oldname table also works to support
    backwards compatible renames

0.8.5 (01-June-2019)

Pull in pgdbconn so we can fully replace Psycopg2 with Psycopg2-binary

  * pgdbconn requires psycopg which requires postgres-client rather than just
    needed psycopg-binary. Pyscopg requires postgres to be installed while the
    binary version doesn't so this simplifies our life a bit

    This is the reverse of dfa03cd, where pgdbconn was pulled out. It isn't
    actually isn't being used as a module elsewhere and okay with some code
    duplication even if it was

0.8.4 (05-June-2019)

Drop first before anything else

  * We now order DROP statements before other statements. Motivating case is a
    column type change where the column has an index that is only for a certain
    type. We should drop that index before changing the column type.
    Previously, drops happened last.

0.8.3 (04-June-2019)

Fix columns not changing types

  * Turns out that slight reorderings of the columns in a table would result in
    alter statements not being generated at all

0.8.2 (01-May-2019)

DevotedHealth fork

  * BREAKING CHANGE: You need to specify --dbname for yamltodb and dbtoyaml.
    This was to better clarify as yamltodb now allows you to compare two yaml
    files

  * yamltodb allows you to compare two yaml files. Instead of --dbname, pass
    the yaml that represents the databaes into --db-spec

  * Tests run in CircleCI to match our other repositories

  * Update dependency to psycopg2-binary to avoid deprecation message

  * Only map dependencies for functions that are explictly present

  * A bunch of other fixes that were merged into master at the time of fork

NOTE: I had cut a new branch off of master at the time and it resulted in some
breaking changse for us. Instead, going to branch from release 0.8.0 which
we've been using in production for a year now instead. If there are patches
that we need from master or even the release 0.8 branch (which also had
breaking changes for us), we can cherry-pick them over.
